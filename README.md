### Description

This project allows users to save notes and delete notes. Saving a note updates the JSON database where all notes are stored by adding the new note and deleting a note updates the database by removing the unwanted note.

### Installation

Go to https://amazingnotetaker.herokuapp.com/ to access this application

### Usage

This application allows for anyone to save notes. It is mostly to show that I can effectively use front-end and back-end and can understand routes and can update a database based on client-side interaction.

### Contributing

Developers can contribute however they'd like. Whether it be debugging, perfecting the code, or improving functionality.

### Tests

Go to https://amazingnotetaker.herokuapp.com/ and save and delete any notes you want.
